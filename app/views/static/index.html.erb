<p>Welcome to the Research Repository, where you can organize your research for your various projects in something resembling an organized fashion.</p>

<p>After logging in, you may create a project and a wish list of items you want to access or purchase for research purposes for that project. These items might be books, films, episodes of television, informative videos, websites, or other things. You may also add a source location for that item, and indicate whether it is free or if there's a fee involved for the use or purchase. Items may have multiple sources listed, such as getting a book from the library versus purchasing it yourself.</p>
